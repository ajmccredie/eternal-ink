        <p>We know that preparation and aftercare for your new tattoo are just as important as choosing the artist and design to suit your needs.</p>
        <p>Whether this is your first tattoo, a cover up, or an addition to your gallery, you may find the information included useful.</p>
        <p>The video links below are to one of our favourite tattoo artist content creators (Haylee Tattooer), and are only a small selection of all they've published.</p>

        <h2>Tattoo Aftercare Information</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Keep the tattoo covered with a bandage or wrap for 2-3 hours after tattooing.</li>
                <li>Gently wash the tattoo with mild soap and water 2-3 times a day for the first week.</li>
                <li>Apply a thin layer of tattoo ointment or cream to the tattoo 2-3 times a day for the first week.</li>
                <li>Avoid soaking in water for at least two weeks.</li>
                <li>Keep the tattoo out of direct sunlight or tanning beds for at least two weeks.</li>
