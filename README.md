# Features (UX)
## Strategy
The target audience for the Eternal Ink website includes individuals interested in tattoos, seeking a professional tattoo studio, or looking for inspiration and guidance in the tattooing process. The website caters to a diverse audience, including tattoo enthusiasts, potential clients, and those exploring tattoo art for the first time. <br>

_A first-time user_ will gain an instant impression of the business as being professional, clean, fresh and friendly. They will be able to see a variety of tattoo designs, a view of the studio and information regarding contacting the studio and making a booking. A first-time user is less likely than a returning user to spend time on the advice and terms pages. <br>
_A returning user_ will be able to see the suppliers used, spend more time looking at designs and return to the advice section as much as required. <br>
_A regular user_ will be looking to see new designs and work posted, and is likely to be using the advice section. <br>
_The site owner_ will generate and maintain interest in their business through the platform to showcase their work, provide helpful advice and guidance to potential clients, and allow users to book tattoo appointments. <br>
## Scope
The key important features are the gallery, the advice and terms, and the ability to contact the studio. <br>

_Gallery:_ A gallery section showcasing various tattoo designs created by the studio. Users can view the designs and get inspiration for their own tattoos. The company can keep the content on this page up to date and showcase the best and most relevant works. <br>
_Advice and Terms:_ An advice section providing helpful information about tattoo care, choosing designs, and aftercare instructions. This section aims to educate and guide users in making informed decisions about their tattoos. The terms and conditions are also required here so that potential clients have access to all the relevant information linked to their booking. <br>
_Contact:_ A contact page where users can contact the company and specify the nature of their contact (new tattoo, cover up or chat) and upload any relevant images. This page also includes the company address and a Google maps link.
## Structure
The information required from the scope plane is therefore organised into four distinct sections: a home page with a good first impression and the ability to navigate to the other pages, the gallery page, the advice and terms page and the contact page.<br>

The information is hierarchically organised in order to be intuitive for the user. The navigation bar is clear and at the top of the page under the company logo. The company social media links are at the base of the page. The information flows in such a manner as to first generate interest (home page and gallery), educate more deeply (advice and terms), and then allow and encourage reaching out to the company (contact). This creates a logical and intuitive structure that allows users to easily find what they need and complete their tasks efficiently. <br>

_Home Page:_ Features an eye-catching hero section with the Eternal Ink logo and a captivating image of the studio. Further down the page, images of top-quality brands are presented on a clock to reinforce themes of time; Provides a brief introduction to the tattoo studio, highlighting its expertise, uniqueness, and dedication to artistic expression; Includes call-to-action buttons within the navigation to lead users to book an appointment or explore the gallery. <br>
_Gallery:_ Showcase a diverse range of high-quality tattoo designs created by the studio. <br>
_Advice and Terms:_ Provide informative and well-organized sections that offer guidance on various tattoo-related topics, such as design selection, aftercare, and likely FAQs; Uses clear headings, subheadings, and bullet points to improve readability; Includes a terms and conditions section. <br>
_Contact:_ A dedicated page for booking appointments, including a form where users can provide their contact information and preferences; Ensure the booking form is user-friendly, intuitive, and straightforward, requesting only necessary details while minimising friction, and allowing users to supplement their descriptions with images if appropriate. A _thank you page_ with a redirect will be used to confirm form submission. <br>
## Skeleton
The logo is placed centrally and will be mostly black with a subtle accent colour. The image of the inside of the tattoo studio will be prominent on the home page and the company has a large number of green leafy plants. The company is also based in a garden centre unit. A theme of plants and leafy architecture is used through the site, maintain a fresh and clean feel which compliments the company brand identity. <br>

The fonts used on the site compliment those in the logo. They are selected and downloaded from _Google Fonts_. The main heading and the navigation are ‘Smooch Sans’ and the main body text is ‘Barlow Semi Condensed’. There are accent phrases and quotes shown in ‘Zeyada’ (to give a more personal touch).<br>

To compliment the leafy plants and maintain a cohesive aesthetic, the following colour scheme was adopted:
- Deep Forest Green (#004D40): This deep shade of green will serves to symbolise the everlasting and natural aspects of "Eternal Ink."
- Jet Black (#000000) Black is a classic and versatile colour that can be used as an accent to provide a sleek and sophisticated look. It can be used for text, navigation icons, and borders to create contrast against the green and gray.
- Warm Gray (#808080, partial transparency) Used as a neutral colour. This is the main background colour to be used as a backdrop for other images and for some of the text.
- Linen (#E9DCC9, 50% transparency) Used as a warmer neutral colour to provide additional contrast in boxes for text against background images. This is to make things more useable. 

This colour combination of green, black, gray, and warm cream evokes a sense of timelessness, prestige, and creativity, which aligns well with the theme of "Eternal Ink." They are used to create a visually appealing balance.<br>
## Surface
The style and layout of the company name, the leaves that form the style of the background of the company names, the navigation bar, and the social icons and border at the bottom are the same on each of the pages. The navigation bar shows the user which page they are on by underlining the name. There are some additional recurring background images which are used on the page, but are consistent with the branding and colour scheme. The incorporation of a strong and consistent colour scheme maintains a cohesive visual identity. <br>

Throughout the site the aim is for simplicity and clarity in terms of both the layout and the presented text. The design is clean and uncluttered, allowing users to focus on the essential content. The language is clear and concise for effective communication. <br>

It is essential for the site to be visually appealing due to the nature of the business itself. The site will utilise high-quality images to showcase the designs and work. <br>

Accessibility is considered, adhering to accessibility guidelines for suitable colour contrast, use of headings, and alt tags for images. The form, videos, and map as interactive elements have clear instructions or visual cues. The YouTube videos can be opened in YouTube with subtitles if required. <br>

This final layer and the stylistic choices, including the responsiveness to screen size changes are detailed below, with relevant screen shots. 
_The Homepage_
The company logo is prominent, alongside the slogan "The enduring power of art". Immediately under the slogan is the navigation bar.
![Main start up view of homepage on average PC screen](https://github.com/ajmccredie/eternal-ink/assets/127118760/3e41809f-f473-451d-90a8-1199954f97d3)
Under the short blurb about the company and ethos, there is a hero image of the studio and an invite to the site user.

<br>
Below the image of the studio are some logos of high quality tattoo supplies, and then social media links at the bottom of the screen. An image of a clock is used here to reinforce style ideas of time and eternity.

_The Gallery_
The top of the gallery page features an array of eye-catching tattoos to show off the studio's work.
![Main four column view of tattoo gallery](https://github.com/ajmccredie/eternal-ink/assets/127118760/6c7a5fa8-3747-4950-9d46-d2de86e9243f)
The lower half of the page features a large number of small 'sketches' to demonstrate further designs the studio wishes to present.

Under the art work is a call to action link (as well as the social media links which provide the consistent footer through the site)

_Advice and Terms Page_
There is a lot of written information on this page, so the contrast and style are important so as to maintain interest for the user without causing a distraction.
![Top view of usual page layout](https://github.com/ajmccredie/eternal-ink/assets/127118760/294ae7f2-2e61-46e1-b3cd-aa7a294e590e)
A curated selection of embedded YouTube videos are presented for the user to interact with, accompanied by very short video synopses on the side (or above depending on the screen width). <br>
The advice on aftercare is also in text on the page so that users do not have to watch the video if they do not want to (or it is inconvenient to do so).
![Links to suggested videos](https://github.com/ajmccredie/eternal-ink/assets/127118760/7a1f3c48-b828-4abd-94a0-8c5bdf70ac29)
The terms and conditions switches to an opaque frame to communicate this section is more serious and should be read more carefully.

_Contact Us_
The contact form is brief and the required inputs are validated. The radio buttons and image uploads are not requirements for validation, because these present additional optional information. 
![Contact form, address and map](https://github.com/ajmccredie/eternal-ink/assets/127118760/c133a1d4-f512-4aab-981c-f43104f83da7)Submission of the form generates a "Thank you" page which acknowledges the receipt of the form and then redirects to the homepage.

The action shot of the artist on this page is to reinforce why the user would want to contact the company, and what they will likely find if they did drop by.

<br>
Web developer tools used in Chrome including those within ‘inspect’ to test responsiveness for a variety of screen sizes and Lighthouse to check overall page performances.<br>

## Bugs and issues
Some issues highlighted in Lighthouse were addressed, including compressing large images (using tinypng.com) to load pages faster and researching reducing some unnecessary JavaScript from the iframes. Some of the suggested page improvements were not possible within the scope of this project.

<br>
Another bug fix was required when the site was first deployed through GitHub pages and the CSS link was not working. I discovered this was due to using absolute file paths (leading the file path names with "/"). I removed these from all of the file paths affected and the issue resolved.
